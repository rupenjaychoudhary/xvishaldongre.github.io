Network Adapter Cards or Networking Interface Card (NICs) - Circuit board or card installed in computer so that it can be connected to a network. 2. Server - A computer designed to process requests and deliver data to other (client) computers over a local network or the Internet. A server may be three types:\n File Server: A file server is a computer that stores files, is attached to a network, and provides shared access of those files to multiple workstation computers. Print Server: A print server is a device that connects printers to client computers over a network. It accepts print request from the computers and sends the jobs to the appropriate printers over the LAN. Communication Server: A communication server is a computer system designed to handle a wide range of communications-based applications.  Station - A station is a computer that is connected with a server computer over the LAN, and communicate with other devices connected with it. HUB - A common connection point for devices in a network. Hubs are commonly used to connect segments of a LAN. A hub contains multiple ports. When a packet arrives atone port, it is copied to the other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see all-packets. Switch - A switch is like a hub in that it is a central point for connecting network cables; however, a switch is able to receive a packet and transmit it to only the destination computer. Router - Routers make the connection to the Internet for LANs. They use a configuration table to decide where packets should go. Access point - A hardware device or a computer’s software that acts as a communication hub for users of a wireless device to connect to a wired LAN. Power Supply - Both wired and wireless networks need a power supply. A wireless network uses the current to generate radio waves. A cabled network sends data interpreted as an electronic pulse. Connector - A network connector refers to any device that used to connect many LAN connection with the hardware of the computer. Shared Peripheral Device - A peripheral device is any device—such as a printer, hard disk drive, CD-ROM drive or modem—that is connected to and controlled by a computer. Any or all of these devices can be accessed by multiple users when connected to a LAN in the proper manner.
